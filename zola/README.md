- Pelican: reStructuredText, markdown, asciidoc, org-mode, whatever-you-want

### ![ehh] explanations

Hugo gets ![ehh] for the template engine because while it is probably the most powerful template engine in the list, after Jinja2, it personally drives me insane, to the point of writing my own template engine and static site generator. Yes, this is a bit biased.

Zola gets ![ehh] for the multi-language support as it only has a basic support and does not offer (yet) things like i18n in templates.

### Pelican notes

Many features of Pelican are coming from plugins, which might be tricky to use because of version mismatch or lacking documentation. Netlify supports Python and Pipenv but you still need to install your dependencies manually.
